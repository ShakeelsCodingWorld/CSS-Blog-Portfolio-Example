🌐 Personal Web Profile – HTML & CSS Styling Project
Hey there! Welcome to my Personal Web Profile project. This is a simple but stylish webpage I built using just HTML and CSS. The goal? To introduce myself as a budding web developer and showcase my early projects in a clean and visually engaging way. Think of it as my digital handshake. 👋

🚀 What This Project Is
This webpage includes:

A personal profile header with a photo, my name, and a short bio.

A Projects section that lists both web development and design projects I’ve worked on.

A simple Contact section letting people know where they can find me online.

✨ What I Learned
As a beginner in web development, this project helped me level up in the following areas:

🎨 CSS Styling
I learned how to use colors, fonts, and layout styles to create a visually appealing header and background.

I used the background-image property to make the page pop with a cool hypnotic pattern.

I also styled specific text with font size, color, and weight to create a sense of visual hierarchy.

🧱 HTML Structure
I practiced building with semantic HTML elements like div, ul, h1, and p.

I organized my content into sections so it’s easy to read and navigate.

I added a personal touch with a profile image and a list of the projects I’m proud of.

💻 Developer Skills
I linked an external CSS stylesheet to keep my styles clean and separate from the HTML.

I used class selectors in CSS to apply unique styles to parts of the page (like .about-me and .title).

I learned how to combine HTML and CSS to create a page that feels uniquely mine.

🌈 Cool Styling Highlights
A vibrant CornflowerBlue header with my name in Azure text. Fancy and eye-catching.

A faded “about me” section using opacity: 0.7 for a subtle design effect.

Custom background image that gives the page a trippy, modern look.

Font-family set to Georgia for that classic, readable vibe
